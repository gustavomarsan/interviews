# Class  Appoint has a list of 24 hour set in 0s. and a number of meeting already scheduled. 
# If an appointment is schedule (by method schedule(hour, long) ) then move 1 to the list space and  add 1 to  meeting acum
# in case there isn't an appointment in this hour yet. (the list space was 0).
# If the appointment to schedule is more than 1 hour long, then use the next hours too.
# method is_full() returns if there is free space for schedule more appointments. 
# Appointments should begin in exact hour.
# in this case we use a list in O(1) complexity because we donÂ´t read the whole list, we acces it directly the index
