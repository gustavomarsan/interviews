92. Reverse Linked List II
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the 
list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
                 l   r
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
Example 2:
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
Note : check if left is in the begining of the list and if left is in the last element
